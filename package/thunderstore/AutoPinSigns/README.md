# Auto Pin Signs
Create map pins based on sign's text you placed. Useful for nomap + Compass playthrough. Kinda useless otherwise. Don't break immersion while saving pin functionality to nomap playthroughs.

The mod was not intended as a fully functional replacement for pins in nomap walkthrough. Just to pin most important POI like main base and remote camps or to be some beacon for sailing home.

## Features
* Creates a pin on the minimap when you set text on sign that fits list
* Configurable strings filter for 5 map pins (fire,base,hammer,dot,portal)
* Deletes a pin on text change or sign destroying
* Automatically adds new pin on close proximity with the sign (when it is loaded)
* Support of html flavored signs like "<color="red">pin"
* Console command "autopinsigns clear 5" will erase all pins from map in that radius around player

## Known issues
* if someone destroyed pinned sign when you're not there your pin will stay. Still you can build and destroy sign in that place to remove your pin from map.

## Installation (manual)
